// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

choose random two numbers to add

ex: 5 and 10

add them together

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


if (number % 2) == 0:

depending on the remainder we get from adding 
a number and diving by 2, we can see if its a 
off or even.


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

choose 5 different digits
add all 5 digits to get a sum
divide the sum by the number of digits
choose the lowest and highest numbers and list them in order
